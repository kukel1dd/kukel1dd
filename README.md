- 👋 Hi, I’m @kukel1dd
- 👀 I’m interested in learning code because I want to have challenges in my work environment i'd like to overcome. I have been having a lot of fun trying to figure out how to create 
      projects the stress is overwhelming but it always feels so rewarding when I overcome a roadblock in my project. to me it all feels like a puzzle game and it sounds like a dream to 
      have a job in a field where i'm having fun and learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python as of 2022, Visual basics as of 2023, and C# as of 2024.
-  I have started working in my class with forms in the .NET framework as of 2024 as well as learning Microsoft Access in Another one of my classes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of now I'm focused on learning.
- 📫 How to reach me kukelidd2@gmail.com

Learning to code has been a very fun experience testing my brain over all these projects i have been looking at.
As i'm new to programming I find it really interesting to see something so simple at facevalue broken down with all the code that actually goes into running something and makes me want to 
keep learning more!


Thanks for reading - Luke
