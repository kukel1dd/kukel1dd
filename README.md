- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python as of 2022, Visual basics as of 2023, and C# as of 2024.
-  I have started working in my class with forms in the .NET framework as of 2024 as well as learning Microsoft Access in Another one of my classes.

Learning to code has been a very fun experience testing my brain over all these projects i have been looking at.
As i'm new to programming I find it really interesting to see something so simple at facevalue broken down with all the code that actually goes into running something and makes me want to 
keep learning more and more!


Thanks for reading - Luke
