- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python as my first language

- 📫 How to reach me kukelidd2@gmail.com

Learning to code has been a very fun experience testing my brain over all these projects i have been looking at.
As i'm new to programming I find it really interesting to see something so simple at facevalue broken down with all the code that actually goes into running something and makes me want to 
keep learning more and more!

Thanks for reading - Luke
